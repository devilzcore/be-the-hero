# Application

**The importance of helping an NGO** <br>
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are private, non-profit civil society entities whose purpose is to defend and promote a political cause. This cause can be virtually of any kind: human rights, animal rights, indigenous rights, gender, the fight against racism, the environment, urban issues, immigrants, among many others.

**Be the Hero** is a project that aims to help, in a financial way, a charity, helping it to maintain itself.
